# Repository Naming Convention

When creating new repositories it is often difficult to decide on a name that reflects the purpose and scope of the repository. 

The goal of naming your repositories in a defined manner is to help with indexing and future access. 

As developers, we often look back at our past work for help with tasks or guidance in problem solving. Establishing a purposeful naming convention helps in reducing the amount of time it takes to retrieve necessary resources.

#### Naming Convention

In order to effectively name and manage your repositories you will use this naming convention:
```
[purpose]-[language]-[use_case]-[name]
```

Where:
- `[purpose]`: Classifies the repository's purpose (e.g., work, personal, portfolio, learning, template, etc.). Purpose is limited to a single word with, no leading or trailing spaces.

- `[language]`: Represents the primary programming language used (e.g., javascript, python, java, bash, cpp, etc.). Language is limited to a single word, with no leading or trailing spaces

- `[use-case]`: Describes the project's scope or use case (e.g., website, cms, docker-configuration, cli, web-server, etc.). Use case is limited to two words separated with a single dash `-`, with no leading or trailing spaces, and should follow a subject-verb pattern.

- `[name]`: A unique name for the project (e.g., daffodils, turtles, jeffrey, etc.). Name can be multiple words separated with a single dash `-`, however, it is encouraged that you limit the name to a single word, with no leading or trailing spaces.

#### Examples

Here are some examples of repository names using this convention:

```
work-python-website-juno

personal-javascript-cms-cadmus

portfolio-java-cli-esspresso

template-bash-docker-config-ahab

informational-markdown-math-equations-newton

learning-python-machine-learning-brainiac
```

#### Benefits
This revised naming convention provides several benefits:
- Clearly communicates the repository's purpose and content

- Helps with repository organization and discovery

- Enables easier filtering and searching for specific repositories

- Reduces ambiguity and confusion when working with multiple repositories

#### Verbose Abbreviations

Here is an established list of approved words for each category:

- purpose: 
    - work 
    - personal
    - portfolio 
    - learning
    - education
    - informational
    - template
    - experimental

Using this revised naming convention and approved abbreviations, you'll be able to create clear, descriptive, and consistent repository names.
